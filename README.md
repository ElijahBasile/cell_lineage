# cell_lineage (CompuCell3D)

### Model Purpose

The purpose of this model is to show which cells are descendents of who within a proliferating tumor, represented by alternating colors.

Another key add-on to this model is the use of a 'Parameter Scan' which loops through different values in the python and XML determined in each simulation.
